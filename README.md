# Affirmations and Activities Modeling to Exercise Neuroplasticity and Insight Generation in Cognitive Domain - Database systems term project
This project is a prototype for a mood lifter application which works as a self help tool for mental health, named as All about you.

There exists a growing demand for more mental health techniques and technologies to help people mitigate negative thoughts and feelings. That‚Äôs why we believe our project has the potential to help people be more mindful by offering suggestive activities for their respective mood. Something we feel has the potential to improve their overall well-being.

This project demonstrates polyglot persistence via a self help application prototype that is based on neuroplasticity.
The prototype uses
MySQL, MongoDB and S3 databases to exercise its goals to suggest affirmations and activities associated with moods and feeling sentiment score.
MongoDB aggregation pipelines and SQL functionalities have been applied for the various goal achievements. 
Redshift functionalities have been used to implement star schema design for data warehousing. The data warehouse acts as an analytical resource for the cognitive domain.

We had a lot of fun working on this project. As a part of this, we also created a pitch deck as a fun element!
